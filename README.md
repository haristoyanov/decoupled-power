# Decoupled Power Supply

The goal of this project is to create a low-noise, decoupled power supply to power sensitive instrumentation in experimental research laboratories. This power supply will turn 120 VAC wall power into clean, adjustable output DC power, as well as break potential ground loops by being decoupled from the wall power by an isolation barrier.
