Contains the data that we took on the SR-1 spectrum analyzer in the Young Lab at UCSB using the method described in the README. 

Files and Descriptions:
- "0602Vrmsoutputwide copy.TXT": 2 column data of RMS Voltage (V) against frequency (Hz) for a wide sweep (0 to 1500 Hz) measured at the output of Power Supply.

- "0602Vrmsinputwide copy.TXT": 2 column data of RMS Voltage (V) against frequency (Hz) for a wide sweep (0 to 1500 Hz) measured at the input of PS.

- "0602Vrmsinputnarrow copy.TXT": 2 column data of RMS Voltage (V) against frequency (Hz) for a narrow sweep around 60 Hz measured at the input of PS. 
   Averaged for longer than in the wider sweep in the files labeled "wide" to get better resolution around the 60 Hz peak. 

- "0602Vrmsoutputnarrow copy.TXT": 2 column data of RMS Voltage (V) against frequency (Hz) for a narrow sweep around 60 Hz measured at the output of PS. 
   Averaged for longer than in the wider sweep in the files labeled "wide" to get better resolution around the 60 Hz peak. 
   
- "0602inputwide copy.TXT": 2 column data of Voltage Noise spectral density (V/rtHz) against frequency (Hz) for a wide sweep (0 to 1500 Hz) measured at input.

- "0602outputwide copy.TXT": 2 column data of Voltage Noise spectral density (V/rtHz) against frequency (Hz) for a wide sweep (0 to 1500 Hz) measured at output.

- "0602noisefloorSR copy.TXT": 2 column data of Voltage Noise spectral density (V/rtHz) against frequency (Hz) for a wide sweep (0 to 1500 Hz) measured
  without power supply plugged in to get an idea of the noise floor of the SR-1. To be subtracted from the data before we plot it.
